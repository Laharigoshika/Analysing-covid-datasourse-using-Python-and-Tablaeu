# Analysing-covid-ddatasourse-using-Python-and-Tablaeu

Create python scripts and, preferably Jupyter notebooks, for the following:

Using the spreadsheet with the 2018 data, create a scatter plot that plots mean household income against the percentage of the population with health insurance.  Change the color of the bubbles to green and use the documentation on matplotlib.pyplot.scatter to change the bubbles to stars (5 points).
Using the spreadsheet with the consolidated COVID data that you can download from the page A Line Chart in Python in this module, create a line graph that shows the moving average and the number of daily cases for Pasco (5 points).
Using the spreadsheet with the consolidated COVID data that you can download from the page A Line Chart in Python, create a visualization that shows the moving average and the number of daily cases for Hillsborough.  The moving average should be in a column chart and the number of daily cases should be in a line graph.  Make sure you use suitable colors for both (5 points).
Using the simplified Car Sales Data, create a (horizontal) bar chart (not a column chart) that shows the total sales and total costs for the Germany, Spain, and Switzerland (10 points).
Recreate the Covid data source from the two .csv. files that you can download from the page Recreating the COVID Data Source from Scratch in this module (5 points).
Use the matplotlib.pyplot package to create a 2 by 2 visualization.  The first row should show the daily cases and the moving average for Osceola County, and the second row should show this information for St Lucie County.  Note that you will first have to extract the data for the two counties from the data source you created in 5 (15 points).
In addition,

Using the Tableau Packaged Workbook that you created in module 3, set up and connect to a Python server.  Write a Python script that compares the unit cost and the list price for a product and return "Lucrative" if the cost price is 75% or less of the list price, and "Not lucrative" if it is not.  Create a visualization that shows, for each product, the unit cost and the list price and uses the Python script to show whether the product is lucrative or not.  Save the result as a Tableau Packaged workbook (15 points)
